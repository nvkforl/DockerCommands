1. what are volumes?
    To persist the data so that it can be shared by other containers 
    even if we delete a conatiner then also data persist in volume location
    then we require docker volume

2. create / list / delete volumes
    docker volume create myvol1
        output: myvol1

    docker volume ls
        output: DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
                local               myvol1

    docker volume rm myvol1
        output: myvol1
        senario: This will remove only myvol1 

    docker volume prune 
       senario: This will remove all the unused volumes presnt in the local

    docker volume inspect myvol1
        output: [
                    {
                        "CreatedAt": "2021-01-14T11:34:38+05:30",
                        "Driver": "local",
                        "Labels": {},
                        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol1/_data",
                        "Name": "myvol1",
                        "Options": {},
                        "Scope": "local"
                    }
                ]

Volumes are of 3 types

1. Anonymous Volumes
     docker run -v /var/lib/mysql

        this is the default persistent volume is stored in /var/lib/docker/random-hash/_data
        /var/lib/mysql -> this is the location of the mysql container's data stored location

2. Named Volumes
     docker run -v nvkData:/var/lib/mysql      

        this is the default persistent volume is stored in /var/lib/docker/nvkData/_data

3. Host volumes or bind volumes
    docker run -v /opt/mysql/local/location:/var/lib/mysql

        This is the customized location where container data location is bind to local Machine's location
        /opt/mysql/local/location
